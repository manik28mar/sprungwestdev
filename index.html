      <p>I’m Manish—a seasoned project and product management professional by trade and an educator at heart. My journey into tutoring began in the most personal way: helping my own child navigate struggles in Math and Physics. Watching them gain confidence and excel ignited a spark in me. Soon, friends and neighbors began noticing the results and asked me to teach their children too. That’s when I realized my true calling—and Sprungwest Tutoring Services was born.</p>     
    <p>At Sprungwest, my philosophy is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No Question is Dumb: Every question matters and curiosity drives success.</li>
      <li>Beyond the Textbook: I teach students to see Math and Physics as tools to understand the real world—not just numbers and formulas.</li>
      <li>Fun Meets Fundamentals: Learning should be engaging, not intimidating.</li>
      <p>What truly sets me apart is my focus on building deep conceptual understanding, strong problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. I believe grades are merely the byproduct of effort and comprehension—when you focus on truly understanding the subject, the marks will take care of themselves.</p>
      <p>If you’re ready to see Math and Physics in a whole new light, with a tutor who’s as invested in your success as you are—welcome to Sprungwest Tutoring!</p>

                Manish is a great teacher. He teaches math and physics at a high level 
                and is very experienced with the Albertan curriculum. He will teach 
                the concepts, and the methods behind the numbers rather than just use formulas.

          <h3 class="testimonial-name">Parker B (Physics 30 Student)</h3>
          <p class="testimonial-text">
            As a physics 30 student I had little love for physics. All it was to  me was formulas and complicated theory that made no sense. I had a very tough time understanding the theory side of physics which is absolutely crucial to doing well. He really made me understand why the formulas are used and the theory behind them all. Furthermore, he went above and beyond and put his passion into really making sure I knew the basics right up to the extra curricular content.
            His love for physics really rubs off and now I see physics in a whole new way. He is very fair when it comes to pricing, and very flexible to adjust the best he can to your schedule. Without Manish my mark would be no where near where it is.

        <p class="testimonial-text">My daughter was struggling with math when she got in to IB programme. Manish addressed her areas of weaknesses, significantly increased her understanding of the subject and encouraged her to work harder. We all owe a lot to Manish for her final marks in nineties.
          What I really like is that Manish teaches the basics, helps to create a solid foundation that one can build on and then good marks in the exam automatically follows. Thanks Manish!</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Manish is more than a tutor he is an experienced educator who's deepest passion is providing a thorough understanding of the topics being presented. Never did I leave a session with him having only answers in my books, I had complete comprehension of the subject and the ability to see real world applications of advanced mathematics. Manish's love for math and science shines through in his lessons and keeps you interested and involved even when the subject matter seemed boring or daunting before.</p>
