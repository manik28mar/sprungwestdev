      <h1>Meet the Visionary Behind Sprungwest Tutoring</h1>
      <img src="./images/whiteboard-pic.jpeg" alt="Manish">

<p>Manish, the founder of Sprungwest Tutoring Services, is a seasoned project and product management professional with a passion for education. His journey into tutoring began in the most personal way—helping his own child navigate through difficult and complex topics struggles in Math and Physics. Watching his child gain confidence and excel ignited a spark in him. Soon, friends and neighbors began noticing the results and approached him to teach their children as well. That’s when Manish realized his true calling, and Sprungwest Tutoring Services was born.</p>
<p>At Sprungwest, my philosophy is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No Question is Dumb: Every question matters and curiosity drives success.</li>
      <li>Strive for excellence, grades will follow: We truly believe in conceptual understanding and critical thinking</li>
      <li>Beyond the Textbook: I teach students to see Math and Physics as tools to understand the real world—not just numbers and formulas.</li>
      <li>Fun Meets Fundamentals: Learning should be engaging, not intimidating.</li>
</ul>
<p>What sets Manish apart is his focus on building deep conceptual understanding, strong problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. He believes that grades are merely the byproduct of effort and comprehension—when students truly understand the subject, the gradesmarks will take care of themselves.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to see Math and Physics in a whole new light, with a tutor who is as invested in your success as you are—welcome to Sprungwest Tutoring!</p>

                Manish is a great teacher. He teaches math and physics at a high level 
                and is very experienced with the Albertan curriculum. He will teach

          <p class="testimonial-text">He is far more than just a tutor – he’s an experienced educator who is deeply passionate about ensuring his students truly grasp the concepts being taught. After each session, I didn't just walk away with answers, but with a solid understanding of the subject and the ability to relate advanced mathematics to real-life scenarios. His genuine love for math and science is evident in his teaching, making even complex or previously uninteresting topics feel engaging and manageable. I highly recommend him for anyone looking to build a strong foundation and confidence in their studies!</p>

        <p class="testimonial-text">I really recommend this service. My son was struggling with math and sciences and even with  help from this school’s teachers,  he was having a hard time and not getting grades past 60-70%  in these subjects. But getting tutoring from  Sprungwest Tutoring, he was able to make  the honor roll with distinction for both grades 11 and 12 and was accepted into his  first choice of university, the U of T. They have a way of  connecting with the students and explaining concepts, which is truly remarkable. I plan on having my youngest son also receive tutoring from them when he starts grade 10 next year, as they really do bring out the very best in their students.</p>

He is very friendly and provides positive feedback.</p>

Quality of coaching is incredible which does not confide only with bookish knowledge but overall development of one's personslity. Coaching is more on practical basis.What more can I say about that My son haswas immensely benefited fron his teachings especially in Maths and Physics. My son was in 12th grade and wanted to go to UofC for mechanical engg.and also wished to pursue the carrer in Canadian Armed forces. We were looking for a tution teacher for him. We were very lucky to have found him. Manish really worked very hard with my son to make his dreams come true. As a result, my son not only got admission in Uni but also got selected in Canadian Airforce. We as a family owe a lot to Mr Manish. Thank you Sir for your efforts to build life of my son.

      <p class="testimonial-text">My experience as a student of Manish for the past few months has been a pleasant one. Our sessions during the week have benefited me greatly in my academic endeavours, and more beyond that.

        Manish has shown himself to be quite knowledgeable, always ready to answer a question. If the answer is not known, he will work with you to find the solution. As he teaches you a new topic, he effectively guides you through the process, even adding bits of trivia such as where what you have learned can be applied, or where it is derived from to further your understanding.
        
        Manish is also quite encouraging. He always challenges you, and pushes you to do the best you can do, but without pressuring you to do so. This has made me confident in my knowledge and skill going forward.
        
        I would definitely recommend Manish as a teacher to any student. He is amazing at what he does!</p>
